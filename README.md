# SOTS AV Effect Options

This is an update of https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamNinjaDSM/JPs_AV_Effect_Options/

Below is the copied README

This was a pseudo-fork of https://gitlab.com/lexxyfox/ror2-av-effect-options

## About

The goal is to allow players to selectively disable in-game audio-visual effects that aren't strictly necessary to enjoy the game without changing game mechanics or balance. This may assist people who, among others; have photosensitivity, are sensitive to sensory overstimulation, or have limited computing resources. Effects can [usually] be toggled mid-stage.

Intended for headed client-side installations. [Should] have no effect on headless installations.

### Currently configurable

- Blast Shower's effects
- Brainstalks's screen effect
- Frost Relic particles and FOV change
- Gasoline's explosion
- Interstellar Desk Plant's indicator ward particle effects
- Kjaro's Band tornado
- Molten Perferators
- Runald's Band explosion
- Shatterspleen explosion
- Spinel Tonic's screen effect
- Sticky Bomb's drops & explosion
- Stone Titan's death effect
- Wandering Vagrant's death explosion
- Weeping Fungus' effects
- Will-o'-the-Wisp explosion
- Plasma Shrimp AV effects

## Configuring

Once this mod is installed, just press ESC in your game client and go to SETTINGS. Risk Of Options will have a tab there where all items have toggles.

## Notes

- Xamarin's xbuild is not compatible with this mod, and will not be supported by me. (msbuild > xbuild)
- This mod is **NOT** guaranteed to come with a virus.
- I'm not a .NET/C# developer, so there's a good argument to be made that I have no idea what I'm doing
